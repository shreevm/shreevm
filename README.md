# 👋 Hello there, I'm Shree Varaa Mangai!

- Master’s student in Artificial Intelligence Systems @ **University of Florida**  
-Passionate about **LLMs, multimodal learning**, and building intelligent, human-centered systems  
-Bridging the gap between data, design & deep learning  

---

##  My Key Ongoing/completed projects 

-  **CareMind**: Clinical QA using LLaMA + MIMIC-IV with RAG & BioBERT  
-  **Insight**: AI Marketing Agent for Meta Ads
- **VISION-CLARITY**: Mitigating hallucination in vision-language models (ViT + BLIP)  
-  **COGNITO-MAP**: Classifying educational questions with Bloom’s Taxonomy

---
##  What I'm Working On
- **InsightPilot**: Developing an AI marketing analyst agent that integrates with the Meta Ads API to fetch real-time campaign data (impressions, spend, CTR, conversions).
- Connecting directly to the Meta Ads API to pull fresh campaign/ad set data (impressions, CTR, spend, conversions, etc.).Ensuring that the system can query live KPIs rather than relying only on pre-stored embeddings.
- **CareMind**: Enhancing a clinical QA system by integrating agentic components into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Exploring LLM agents and reasoning frameworks to improve patient-specific response quality and reliability.  
-  Investigating **agentic systems** with tools like LangChain and AutoGen to enable goal-directed behavior in medical AI applications
